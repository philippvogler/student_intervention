    "- Able to handle multi-output problems.\n",
    "- Uses a white box model. If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the condition is easily explained by boolean logic. By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an artificial neural network), results may be more difficult to interpret.\n",

    "- Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalize the data well. This is called overfitting. Mechanisms such as pruning (not currently supported), setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.\n",
    "- Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.\n",
    "- The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts. Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal decisions are made at each node. Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.\n",
    "- There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems.\n",
    "- Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree.“\n",

    "SVC is the most appropriate model because it performed best on the test set with as little as 100 samples. Prediction time is comparable with knn. Training time is the longest of all used algorithms, but not dramatically long. As expected from a generalizing algorithm the training time is longer than the prediction time. The data must not be kept, which lowers memory cost compared to an instance based algorithm like knn.\n",

Than the SVM shifts the weights towards the criterions on which this differentiation works best. This information is saved in a mathematical expression. When you provide the data for a new student, this expression can predict the chance of the student being successful or not, based on the experience with the students in the original data set.\n",
